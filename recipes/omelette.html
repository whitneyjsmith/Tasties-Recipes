        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <p>Set a frying pan on the stove on medium heat.
            Wipe the pan with olive oil to avoid the eggs from sticking.
            Crack the eggs into a bowl and add salt and pepper.
            Whip the eggs with a fork for a minute.
            Pour eggs into the frying pan and make sure it covers the entire pan.
            Let the eggs cook until they are slightly runny on the top and then add the cheese and ham.
            Cook the eggs until there is little to no runny egg left, fold the omelette, and cook for 1 additional
            minute.
            Scoop the omelette out of the pan onto a plate and enjoy.
