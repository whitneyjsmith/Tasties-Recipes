        <p>This recipe makes two medium iced coffees.
            Boil the water in the microwave for 3-4 minutes.
            Meanwhile, measure and put the ground coffee into a french press.
            Once the water is done boiling, slowly pour it over the coffee and stir if necessary.
            Let the coffee and hot water sit for 3-6 minutes, depending on taste preferences.
            Meanwhile, fill two 12 oz cups with ice so that they are filled to the top.
            When the coffee is done, pour it over the ice so the two cups are evenly filled.
            Add creamer to fill the cup up the rest of the way or to desired level.
