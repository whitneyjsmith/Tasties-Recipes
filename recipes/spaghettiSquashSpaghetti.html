                <p>
                    1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil. <br>
                    2. With a sharp knife, carefully cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. With a spoon, gently
                    remove
                    seeds and discard. Generously rub olive oil on each side of the squash. Place spaghetti squash cut
                    side down on baking sheet. Bake for 35 - 45 minutes or until a fork can pierce the shell easily.
                    <br>
                    3. Cook the sausage while the squash bakes in the oven. After the sausage has browned in the pan,
                    dump it on a plate with a paper towel and pat the grease off. <br>
                    4. Remove the squash from the oven and allow to cool slightly. With a fork, loosen spaghetti squash
                    strands from shell. <br>
                    5. Divide the spaghetti sauce and sausage into 2 parts and spoon onto each side of the squash.
                    Sprinkle with shredded cheese. <br>
                    6. Bake again for 5-7 minutes or until cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly browned. Serve
                    directly from shell.
